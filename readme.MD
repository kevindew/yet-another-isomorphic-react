# Yet Another Isomorphic React

Just a cobbled together play around with Webpack, React and Babel.

There's a million other ones like this (that are more complete) that all seem to have an issue or two.

Useful ones for me have been:

- https://github.com/jlongster/backend-with-webpack
- https://github.com/hellojwilde/react-isomorphic-demo
- https://github.com/webpack/react-webpack-server-side-example
- https://github.com/RickWong/react-isomorphic-starterkit

Though all still feels a bit messy and experimental to me currently.

## Run this

`git clone git@github.com:kevindew/yet-another-isomorphic-react.git`
`cd yet-another-isomophic-react`
`npm install`
`gulp`

Then hit localhost:3000 in your browser.
